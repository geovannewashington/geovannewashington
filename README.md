# Welcome. 🪽

I’m an aspiring general-purpose computing enthusiast with a current focus on web programming. I also enjoy low-level programming, Unix environments, tooling, systems, and graphics programming. If I hadn’t been born poor, I’d probably spend all my time doing recreational programming and playing with math — no, really.  

I’m a Systems Analysis & Development student and a former engineering student at a federal university. I write on Medium about what I learn and stream daily study sessions.

**Currently reading**: K&R  
**Learning**: Express.js, MongoDB and taking CS50         
**Looking forward to**: C++, SDL3, raylib, OpenGL, Python, Flask, SQL, React, TypeScript   
**Improving my skills in**: English, Linux, Neovim, Math, HTML & CSS, Node.js, and writing

I’m always watching or reading something — right now I’m watching The Simpsons and reading A Study in Scarlet, the first Sherlock Holmes novel.

Anyway, that’s enough about me. Feel free to get in touch!
