# Focused. Minimal. Curious. 🪽

No hype — just building, learning, and shipping.  
I use what works: Void Linux, Neovim, and a lean stack.

**Stack:** JavaScript · React · Node.js · Linux · Git

Systems Analysis & Development student. Computing enthusiast. Web dev in progress. Ex-engineering student at a federal university. I write on Medium about what I learn and stream daily study sessions.
